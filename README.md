# lc-3-virtual-machine
A Python implementation of an LC-3 virtual machine

This is a fun project following along with https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html

The original source was written in C, but this is a Python implementation.

running the program:
```
python3 lc3.py <rom filename>
```
