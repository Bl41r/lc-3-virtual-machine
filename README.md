# lc-3-virtual-machine
A Python implementation of an LC-3 virtual machine

This is a fun project following along with https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html

The original source was written in C, but this is a Python implementation.

#### running the program:
```
python3 lc3.py <rom filename>
```

#### From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3
```
Little Computer 3, or LC-3, is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language, which is a type of low-level programming language.

It features a relatively simple instruction set, but can be used to write moderately complex assembly programs, and is a theoretically viable target for a C compiler. The language is less complex than x86 assembly but has many features similar to those in more complex languages
